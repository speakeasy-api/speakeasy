Some of the endpoints in this SDK support pagination. To use pagination, you make your SDK calls as usual, but the
returned response object will have a `next` method that can be called to pull down the next group of results. If the
return value of `next` is `null`, then there are no more pages to be fetched.

Here's an example of one such pagination call:



```typescript copy
import { SDK } from "openapi";
import { PaginationCursorBodyResponse } from "openapi/dist/sdk/models/operations";

const sdk = new SDK({
  security: {
    apiKeyAuth: "Token YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
  globalPathParam: 100,
  globalQueryParam: "some example global query param",
});

sdk.paginationCursorBody({
  cursor: 868337,
}).then((res: PaginationCursorBodyResponse) => {
  if (res.statusCode == 200) {
    do {
      // handle items

      res = res.next();
    } while (res);
  }
});
```
