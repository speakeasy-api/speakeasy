# Release Command

Create a release PR with summarized changes from merged pull requests.

## Steps

1. Switch to the main branch if not already
1. Run the ./scripts/upgrade.bash script to get the list of merged PRs caused by upgrading openapi-generation dep
1. **IMPORTANT: Filter out PRs which are internal changes. PRs with titles starting with "chore:" are almost definitely internal change. You can verify if it's an internal PR or public PR by reading any files changed under `changelogs/` in the PR. If no files were changed under this directory, this is an internal PR. Read the `changelogs/` directory for more context.
1. You should use `gh` to go and read the descriptions and `changelogs/` directory.
1. Create a user-facing summary for each language with relevant changes
1. Group changes by programming language (python, typescript, java, go, csharp, php, ruby, terraform)
1. Ignore "v2" suffixes when categorizing (pythonv2 â†’ python, typescriptv2 â†’ typescript)
1. **Create a PR title that includes**:
   - Which languages have been updated
   - Whether changes are features or fixes
   - Brief description of what was changed
   - Format: `feat(lang1): brief description of feature changes; fix(lang1) description of fixes; feat(lang2) ....`
1. Create a new branch off main with format: `release/vX.Y.Z` or `release/YYYY-MM-DD-HH:mm`
1. Commit the changes with the summarized message
1. Push the branch and create a PR with the full changelog



The PR description should be formatted as:
**IMPORTANT** exclude ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) from PR descriptions
