## What is Speakeasy?

[Speakeasy](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/) gives your users the developer experience that makes API integrations easy.

Don't put the burden of integration on your users. Take your APIs to market with best-in-class, enterprise-ready SDKs, Terraform providers, SDK docs, and more.

![Group 27](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/assets/68016351/07335321-2ae1-41de-a1b1-3be72df38a90)

### Key Features

* **LLM Powered API Maintenance** - Keep your API schema up to date and follow best practices with automatic maintenance powered by best-in-class LLMs. Try it out now in the CLI with `speakeasy suggest` or embed it into your GitHub workflow using our [action](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action). 
* **Production-Quality SDKs** - Ergonomic, type-safe, and fault-tolerant client libraries built for production use cases with idiomatics optimized for each language. Embed additional capabilities like auth, retries, pagination, and more using spec-based extensions. 
* **Production-Quality Terraform Providers** - Expose your API for infrastructure-as-code use cases with fully featured Terraform providers. 
* **SDK Docs** - Markdown usage snippets for every single operation and model in your SDK. Export usage snippets and host them on a branded SDK and API docs site using our Docusaurus React plugin. 
* **Distribution to Package Managers** - A complete pipeline for distributing your libraries to popular package managers like npm, PyPI, Maven, and Terraform Registry. 
* **Supports Open Standards** - Speakeasy works with your existing API framework by supporting OpenAPI3.X and other open standards. Plug and play not rip and replace. 

For upcoming features and bug fixes, check out our [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/speakeasy-api/projects/6/views/1).

## What is the Speakeasy CLI?

The [Speakeasy CLI](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/speakeasy-cli/getting-started) is a tool for interacting with the Speakeasy platform that brings the functionality of Speakeasy into your development workflow. 

You can run the Speakeasy CLI locally or in your CI/CD pipeline to validate your API specs, generate SDKs, and more. Looking to embed this into your GitHub CI/CD? Check out [these docs](https://speakeasyapi.dev/docs/create-client-sdks/github-setup/) instead. 

Here are a few key functions of the CLI:

* `generate` - Generate idiomatic client SDKs from your API specs.
* `validate` - Validate the correctness of your API specs. The CLI has a built-in command to validate your spec for SDK readiness and post helpful error messages.
* `suggest` - Use an LLM to autocorrect your spec validation failures. 
* `merge` - Work with your existing documentation workflows by merging your API specs into a single spec. 
* `auth` - Authenticate with the platform and manage API keys. 

For a complete list of commands check out our [reference](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/speakeasy-cli/getting-started) or type `speakeasy` and our interactive mode will take you through the available functions. 

## Design Choices

Each SDK generated by Speakeasy is idiomatic to the language it's generated for while sharing common patterns with SDKs for other languages to allow for switching between them. Using shared patterns also helps to keep the Speakeasy generation engine efficient while supporting many languages.

Here are some of the Speakeasy design decisions:

* Each SDK generally implements a base SDK class that contains the methods for each of the API endpoints defined in the OpenAPI document.
* Where possible, Speakeasy generates fully typed models from the OpenAPI document, separating models defined as components in the docs from models defined in line with operations.
* Based on the configuration in the OpenAPI document, Speakeasy annotates types using reflection metadata to determine how to serialize and deserialize them.
* To get SDKs to your end users quickly, Speakeasy generates full packages for each language that you should be able to publish to a package registry with little additional work. If you're interested in having a managed pipeline to your package manager, check out the Speakeasy Generation GitHub Action.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew install speakeasy-api/homebrew-tap/speakeasy
```

### Script (macOS and Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Chocolatey (Windows)

```cmd
choco install speakeasy
```

### Manual Installation

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/releases), extract, and add the binary to your path.

### Keeping Up to Date

The CLI will warn you if you're running an outdated version. To update the CLI run:

```bash
speakeasy update
```

Alternatively, install the latest version via your package manager.

## Getting Started With the Speakeasy CLI

Once you have installed the Speakeasy CLI, you can verify it's working by running:

```bash
speakeasy --help
```

See the Speakeasy docs for [how to get started with the Speakeasy CLI](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/speakeasy-cli/getting-started).

### Authenticating the Speakeasy CLI

The Speakeasy CLI depends on Speakeasy Platform APIs. Connect your Speakeasy CLI with the Speakeasy Platform by running:

```bash
speakeasy auth login
```
You'll be redirected to a login URL to select an existing workspace or create a new workspace on the platform. If your local network prevents you from accessing the login page prompted by the CLI, you can log in manually at [app.speakeasyapi.dev](https://app.speakeasyapi.dev), retrieve an API key, and populate a local environment variable named `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` with the key.
