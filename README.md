## What is Speakeasy ?

[Speakeasy](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/) gives your users the developer experience that makes API integrations easy. Don't put the burden of integration on your users. Take your APIs to market with best in class enterprise ready sdks, terraform providers, SDK docs and more.

![Group 27](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/assets/68016351/07335321-2ae1-41de-a1b1-3be72df38a90)

### Key Features

* **LLM Powered API Maintenance** - Keep your API schema up to date and following best practices with automatic maintenance powered by best in class LLMs. Try it out now in the cli with `speakeasy suggest` or embed it into your Github workflow using our [action](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action). 
* **Production Quality SDKs** - Ergonomic, Typesafe and Fault Tolerant client libraries built for production use cases with idiomatics optimised for each language. Embed additional capabilities like auth, retries, pagination and more using spec based extensions. 
* **Production Quality Terraform Providers** - Expose your API for infrastructure as code use cases with fully featured Terraform providers. 
* **SDK Docs** - Markdown usage snippets for every single operation and model in your SDK. Export and host usage snippets in a branded SDK and API docs site using our docusaurus react plugin. 
* **Distribution to Package Managers** - A complete pipeline for distributing your libraries to popular package managers like `npm`, `pypi`, `maven` and `hashicorp registry`. 
* **Supports Open Standards** - Speakeasy works with your existing API framework by supporting OpenAPI3.X and other open standards. Plug and and play not rip and replace. 

For upcoming features and bug fixes check out our [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/speakeasy-api/projects/6/views/1).

## What is the Speakeasy CLI ?

This CLI is a tool for interacting with the [Speakeasy](https://docs.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/speakeasy-cli/) platform. The CLI brings the functionality of Speakeasy into your local development workflow. It can be run locally or in your CI/CD pipeline to validate your API specs, generate SDKs and more. Looking to embed this into your Github CI/CD ? Check out these docs instead. 

Here are a few key functions of the CLI. For a complete list of commands check out our [reference](https://speakeasyapi.dev/docs/product-reference/speakeasy-cli/getting-started/) or just type `speakeasy` and our interactive mode will take you through the available functions. 

* `generate` - Generating idiomatic client SDKs from your API specs:
* `validate` - Validating the correctness of your API specs. The CLI has a built in command to validate your spec for SDK readiness and post helpful error messages.
* `suggest` - Use an LLM to auto correct your spec validation failures. 
* `merge` - Work with your existing documentation workflows by merging your API specs into a single spec 
* `auth` - Authenticate with the platform and manage API keys. 

## Design Choices

All the SDKs we generate are designed to be as idiomatic to the language they are generated for as possible while being similar enough to each other to allow some familiarity between them, but also to allow for an efficient generation engine that is capable of supporting many languages. Some of the design decisions we made are listed below:

* Each of the SDKs generally implement a base SDK class that contains the methods for each of the API endpoints defined in the OpenAPI document.
* Where possible we generate fully typed models from the OpenAPI document and separate those models defined as components in the docs and those that are defined inline with operations.
* We use reflection metadata where possible to annotate types with the required metadata needed to determine how to serialize and deserialize them, based on the configuration in the OpenAPI document.
* We generate full packages for each language that should be able to be published to a package registry with little additional work, to get them in your end-users hands as quickly as possible. If you're interested in having a managed pipeline to your package manager check out our Github action.

If you're interested in having managed Github repos generated for your SDKs or enterprise support reach out to us [here](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/request-access) or [come chat with us](https://calendly.com/d/drw-t98-rpq/simon-sagar-speakeasy). We'd love to help you build out API dev ex.

> We may capture metadata on usage of the CLI to better understand API (OpenAPI) features so that we can build better code generators and other tools over time

## Installation

### Homebrew (MacOS and Linux)

```bash
brew install speakeasy-api/homebrew-tap/speakeasy
```

### Script (MacOS and Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Chocolatey (Windows)

```cmd
choco install speakeasy
```

### Manual Installation

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/releases), extract and add the binary to your path.

### Keeping up to date

The CLI will warn you if you're running an out of date version. To update the CLI run:

```bash
speakeasy update
```

or install the latest version via your package manager.

## Getting Started with the Speakeasy CLI

Once you installed the Speakeasy CLI, you can verify it's working by running:

```bash
speakeasy --help
```

See the [docs](https://docs.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/speakeasy-cli/getting-started) for more information on how to get started with the Speakeasy CLI.

### Authenticating Speakeasy CLI

Speakeasy CLI depends on Speakeasy Platform APIs. Connect your Speakeasy CLI with Speakeasy Platform by running:

```bash
speakeasy auth login
```

You'll be redirected to a login URL to select an existing workspace or create a new workspace on the platform. If you're local network prevents 
accessing the login page prompted by the CLI you can login manually at [app.speakeasyapi.dev](https://app.speakeasyapi.dev), retrieve an API key and populate a local environment
variable named `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` with the key.
